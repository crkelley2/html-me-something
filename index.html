                <h2>Made in Memphis</h2>
                <p>Born in Memphis, Tennessee, in a year that shall remain nameless, I grew up in a 
                family of five. Childhood is a bit of a blur, likely due to that unnamed birth year, but
                I remember attending a number of schools due to a host of reasons and enjoying Math the very most.

                <h2>Did a Little Time in Texas</h2>
                <p> Chose a University that I would not choose now, 
                and changed a major that I probably would keep. Ah, but
                such is life. I began my undergraduate studies in Computer Science 
                at Baylor University in Waco, and ended those studies with degrees
                in education (which I would not actually use until a career or so later...
                So, stay tuned!)

                <h2>Trek to Tennessee</h2>
                <p> Headed back to Tennessee for my spouse to get a job. Life has a way of changing you. 
                Shed the spouse and studied for a job of my own. It went very well for a good long time, 
                but not in Tennessee! If you read along, you will see...

                <h2>Call to the Capital</h2>
                <p> Off to the Nation's Capital for my next new adventure, which would
                unexpectedly last several times longer than planned. Oh well, like I said
                about life... It was an awesome ride, which included a stint in the US Attorney's
                Office and a ton of travel for work and play. I was there for 9/11, so that wasn't great.
                But, otherwise, D.C. provided plenty of fun times, good jobs, and great friends.

                <h2>Forever for Family</h2>
                <p> Turns out family matters, so I added to mine. My daughter is amazing! 
                (I am completely objective and unbiased on the topic as you might expect.)
                Because her first half year required continued hospitalization at LeBonheur
                Children's Hospital, we relocated and have never looked back.

                <h2>Time to Teach</h2>
                <p> In a new (old) town with a new baby with great needs, I turned to a new (old)
                profession to make it all work. Teaching in Memphis was and still is both crazy
                challenging and amazingly rewarding. Whether in the public schools, both elementary
                and middle, or as a private tutor at those levels as well as in higher level math,
                the challenge is worth the change, every time.

                <h2>Training in Tech</h2>
                <p> And, now, here we are. Baby steps. Training in tech with LaunchCode Memphis 
                is but a start. Who knows where it can and will lead. I am excited always, 
                challenged daily, and overwhelmed at times. Nonetheless, I consider it an opportunity
                to come full circle in a way that appears almost logical, inevitable even. Back to &quota
                beginning&quot!
