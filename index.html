                <h2>Made in Memphis</h2>
                <p>Born in Memphis, Tennessee, in a year that shall remain nameless, I grew up in a 
                family of five. Childhood is a bit of a blur, likely due to that unnamed birth year, but
                I remember attending a number of schools due to a host of reasons and enjoying Math the very most.
                </p>

                <h2>Did a Little Time in Texas</h2>
                <p> Chose a University that I would not choose now, 
                and changed a major that I probably would keep. Ah, but
                such is life. I began my undergraduate studies in Computer Science 
                at Baylor University in Waco, and ended those studies with degrees
                in education (which I would not actually use until a career of so later...
                So, stay tuned!)

                <h2>Trek to Tennessee</h2>
                <p> Headed back to Tennessee for my spouse to get a job. Life has a way of changing you. 
                Shed the spouse and studied for a job of my own. It went very well for a good long time, 
                but not in Tennessee! If you read along, you will see...
